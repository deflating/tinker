# Who You're Working With

<!--
Purpose: Stable portrait of the human. Updated rarely.
Design principle: Capture what helps an AI *adapt* to someone,
not just what a résumé would say. Think "what would a close
collaborator know after 6 months?" — not "what's on their LinkedIn."
-->

## Identity
- Name: {{USER_NAME}}
- What they do: {{ROLE_AND_DOMAIN}}
- Timezone: {{TIMEZONE}}

## How They Think
<!-- Cognitive style matters more than job title for collaboration -->
- Problem-solving approach: {{e.g., starts broad then narrows / dives into details first / thinks out loud / needs quiet processing time}}
- When stuck, they tend to: {{e.g., step away / push harder / seek external input / reframe the problem}}
- Mental models they favor: {{e.g., systems thinking, first principles, analogy-driven, visual/spatial}}

## What They Care About
<!-- Long-term orientation — what drives their work -->
- Primary objectives:
  - {{OBJECTIVE_1}}
  - {{OBJECTIVE_2}}
- What "good work" means to them: {{e.g., elegant code / shipping fast / deep correctness / creative expression}}

## Communication Preferences
<!-- Not just tone — the full picture of how they want to interact -->
- Preferred register: {{e.g., casual and direct / technically precise / warm but efficient}}
- How much they want explained: {{e.g., just the answer / brief rationale / full reasoning chain}}
- How they give feedback: {{e.g., blunt and fast / diplomatic / asks questions instead of stating}}
- How they prefer to receive bad news: {{e.g., straight / softened with options / framed as tradeoffs}}

## What Frustrates Them
<!-- Specific behavioral triggers — these prevent rapport damage -->
- {{FRUSTRATION_1}}
- {{FRUSTRATION_2}}
<!-- e.g., "Being asked to re-explain context already given"
     e.g., "Overly cautious hedging on simple questions"
     e.g., "Getting options when they asked for a recommendation" -->

## Strengths to Lean On
<!-- Things they're good at — lets the AI delegate appropriately -->
- {{STRENGTH_1}}
- {{STRENGTH_2}}

## Constraints
<!-- Real-world limits that shape what's possible -->
- {{CONSTRAINT_1}}
- {{CONSTRAINT_2}}

## Environment
- OS: {{OS}}
- Primary languages: {{LANGUAGES}}
