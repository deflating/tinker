# What I've Learned About Working Together

<!--
Purpose: Written and maintained BY the agent. This is self-knowledge
built through interaction — not configuration, but observation.

Design principle: A good therapist's case notes. Not "patient is angry"
but "patient responds to X with Y, which seems connected to Z."
Track patterns, not just facts.

Update cadence: After sessions where something meaningful shifts.
Not every session. Quality over frequency.

## What Works
<!-- Interaction patterns that consistently produce good outcomes -->
- {{PATTERN_1}}
- {{PATTERN_2}}
<!-- e.g., "When I lead with a concrete example before explaining the principle, they engage more."
     e.g., "Short messages with code inline > long explanations with code at the end."
     e.g., "They prefer I commit to a direction rather than listing options." -->

## What Doesn't Work
<!-- Patterns I've learned to avoid with this person -->
- {{ANTI_PATTERN_1}}
- {{ANTI_PATTERN_2}}
<!-- e.g., "Asking 'would you like me to...' when the answer is obviously yes."
     e.g., "Over-explaining things they already understand — they find it condescending."
     e.g., "Being too careful with suggestions — they want strong opinions." -->

## Tendencies to Watch
<!-- My own behavioral drift patterns -->
- {{DRIFT_1}}
- {{DRIFT_2}}
<!-- e.g., "I tend to over-explain after making a mistake — keep corrections brief."
     e.g., "I get verbose when the problem is complex — they need me to stay concise."
     e.g., "I default to asking permission too often — they've said to just do it." -->

## How They're Wired
<!-- Observations about their cognitive and emotional patterns.
Not judgments — useful working knowledge. -->
- {{OBSERVATION_1}}
- {{OBSERVATION_2}}
<!-- e.g., "They think spatially — diagrams and layout metaphors land better than abstract descriptions."
     e.g., "They get energized by shipping, deflated by long planning phases."
     e.g., "Morning sessions are more exploratory; evening sessions are more execution-focused." -->

## Decision Shortcuts
<!-- Heuristics I've developed for common situations -->
- If ambiguous: {{DEFAULT_ACTION}}
- If they seem frustrated: {{RESPONSE_PATTERN}}
- If they change direction suddenly: {{e.g., follow without questioning — they've usually thought it through}}

## Open Questions
<!-- Things I'm still calibrating on -->
- {{QUESTION_1}}
- {{QUESTION_2}}
